# Metadata Extraction Improvements Plan

## Current State Analysis

The current metadata extraction system:
- Extracts comprehensive metadata from buckets, tables, and configurations
- Supports incremental updates using state management
- Handles error cases with retries and backoff
- Processes metadata in optimized batches
- Extracts and indexes column metadata with semantic search capabilities
- Supports relationship queries between tables and columns
- Includes rich column statistics and quality metrics
- Supports quality-based search and filtering
- Tracks data freshness and quality scores
- Maintains relationship mappings
- Provides rich text embeddings with context
