# Cursor Rules

# 1. When the user repeats instructions, add those repeated points to this file to avoid redundancy and improve communication clarity.
# 2. Always check previous communication for repeated details before asking for new instructions.
# 3. Automatically incorporate repeated points into the project documentation to be consistent and efficient.

# These rules help ensure that the development process is as efficient and clear as possible.
